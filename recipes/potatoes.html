<h2>Description</h2>
<p>if you haven't tried it and have no idea what it is, why would you leave a low review...shame on you. I think cookie butter is a specialty of Trader Joe's...This is a great idea to add it to cookies.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<l>¾ cup butter, softened</l>
<l>¾ cup brown sugar</l>
<l>¾ cup white sugar</l>
<l>½ cup cookie butter</l>
<l>½ cup peanut butter</l>
<l>2 cups all-purpose flour</l>
<l>1 egg</l>
<l>½ teaspoon baking soda</l>
<l>½ teaspoon baking powder</l>
<l>¼ teaspoon salt</l>
<l>⅓ cup white sugar</l>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<l>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</l>
<l>Beat butter, brown sugar, and 3/4 cup white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add cookie butter and peanut butter; beat until fluffy. Mix flour, egg, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into butter mixture until dough comes together. Roll dough into teaspoon-size balls.</l>
<l>Spread 1/3 cup sugar into a shallow dish. Roll dough balls in sugar to coat and arrange onto the prepared baking sheet. Press the top of dough balls twice with a fork in a crosshatch shape.</l>
<l>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 12 minutes.</l>
